# pythonbot
Learn to code your Discord Bot!


Make sure that before you do any of this, you have Python and any code editor that supports Python (PyCharm Recommended) installed.
And if you have installed the tools thro python, you may continue.


If you don't have Python, go to: https://python.org

and once you have the installer, click install to path, and then install now.

If you don't install to path, it won't work.

After that, go to command prompt and type "pip install discord"
and it will install the tools we need to code the bot.

Then open main.py with PyCharm Community, and you can get started!
