# Intro

Hello, I'm Chris, and I'm gonna show you
how to make a good looking discord bot all by yourself!

# Application
First go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
and create an app. Then, copy the client ID
and go to https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#0 and copy
the client ID to add it to your server.

It will be offline! But we are going to do a little magic
to bring it online!

# Python
Go to https://python.org and download the latest version.
We will use this coding langueage to get the tools and code.
When the installer is open, click Install to path (very important)
and then install now.

NOTE: TO DO THIS NEXT STEP, YOU WILL NEED VISUAL C++ 14/BUILD TOOLS

After it is done installing, open command prompt,
and type "pip install discord" or "pip install discord.py"
which will install the tools we need to code the bot.

# Code Editor
After that get a code editor!
We will use this to edit the code.

There are a lot of good options:
Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/
PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

# File
After that, go to the releases of this Github,
and download File 1.

Extract the zip.
Right click on it and then open in whatever code editor you are using,
or go into the code editor, open folder, and there.

After all that, you can finally get started
making your new shiny discord bot!
